libffi for Multi-OS Engine
--------------------------

This branch is based on the v3.2.1 tag of libffi.
It only includes build fixes for iOS, tvOS and Mac and a new
Mac-static target to create a static library version for OSX.

The Xcode project does not automatically generate the darwin sources
and headers.

Instead the ./build_darwin.sh should be launched to build for all
supported platforms.
